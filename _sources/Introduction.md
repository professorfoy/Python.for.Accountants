# Introduction

This book has been written to introduce the Python programming language to the Accounting Community. The business world is evolving and the accounting profession must keep pace with the way that data is created, managed, stored, analyzed, and communicated to their intended audiences. Surprisingly, the accounting field has fallen behind in understanding and dealing with data. It has been ceding its complex skill opportunities to data analysts and data scientists for years. 

Organizations such as the [American Accounting Association](https://aaahq.org/) and the [AICPA](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/home) have recently been calling for the profession to learn and deal with data. Still, there are daunting questions about how to deal with data in the profession. What programming languages are useful to learn? Should accountants actually learn programming or outsource it? Should accountants just become the defacto Excel expert and forsake other programming languages? What is the best way accountants can make use of their precious time to learn to deal with data? How can accountants get excited enough to dedicate the time necessary to learn more complex skills?

While many languages are useful, Python may be the one language that is most useful and easiest to learn to deal with data. Yes, there are other very useful languages, such as SQL and R, but Python offers a sense of simplicity that other programming languages do not. Learning SQL and R can be saved for a rainy day. They will be fairly easy to learn once one knows the syntax of Python. 

Many accountants have become experts in Excel and use it in their daily work. However, as the amount of data that is needed to be analyzed becomes available, Excel has shortcomings, whereas Python can overcome many of them. As far as learning how to manage data better, let’s be honest – there is no easy way. To learn the tools and techniques does take time. For the accountant willing to level up their skills, learning how to deal with the explosion of data must become more or less a hobby. If you buy into the notion that Python is the best starting point for an accountant to learn how to deal with data, the big question is how to learn it.

Much of the published “How to Learn Python” literature shows the basics of Python, but significantly devoid of accounting related concepts. How this book is different from other “How to Learn Python” type of books? It is written by **Accountants for Accountants**. Accounting language is woven into the fabric of the book. Fortunately, a few Python experts have independently developed Python related accounting tools, which we give attribution and integrate into this book. Using Python, we take newly created and existings tools and sythesize them with concepts learned in a typical Fundamentals of Accounting textbook to help the reader understand them. For accountants to learn Python, we felt that relearning the basics of accounting via the Python programming language is a necessary fundamental step to continue to help get the accounting profession moving in the right direction. 

We do not want to lull the reader into believing this is a cure-all book how to solve every acccounting problem in Python. It is far from it. It is just the first book of its kind as we know it to tackle basic accounting applications using Python. ***<font color = 'darkblue'>We hope that other interested accountants join us in writing how to approach and solve accounting problems using Python.<font>***
